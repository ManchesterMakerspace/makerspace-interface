h2. Issues

ActiveLdap uses "Issues on
GitHub":https://github.com/activeldap/activeldap/issues for
issue tracking. Please submit a issue when you find an
issue.

h2. Rails 3 support

Here is design about Rails 3 support.

h3. must

* We add active_ldap/test_help.rb to support ActiveLdap fixture.
We don't write same codes into test_helper.rb like
http://ruby-activeldap.rubyforge.org/activeldap-fabrication/en/#Install

h3. may

* We support Warden.
* We support Devise
* We support OmniAuth. (instead of Warden)

h3. DONE

* We don't support Rails 3.0.x.
* We provide active_ldap/railtie to initialize ActiveLdap.
* We remove ActiveRecord dependency.
* We depend on ActiveModel instead of ActiveRecord.
* We target to Rails 3.1.0. (Yes, it's not released yet
  but it will be released before we support Rails 3.x.)
* We update the documentation and ensure that the procedure
  for including ActiveLdap in a Rails 3 project is correct.
